// let num = 0;
// let x = setInterval(()=>{
//     console.log(num++);

//     if(num==10){
//         clearInterval(x);
//     }

// Set Interval and clear interval are not part

setTime out and set Interval are not the part of the js but they are the apis which help us in controlling the behaviour of the js.
