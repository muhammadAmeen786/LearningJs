//learnt how the js code works behind the scenes.
/* It is all about the execution context. And when a js file is run it has the global execution context 
which holds all of the other functions and varibles at that time.
Every function have its own local execution context which contains the variables and the code 
that is to be run .
once we are done with a particular function its execution context gets deleted at that particular 
instant.

Hoisting plays an important role in the execution of javascript code.
functions are made available.
and varibles are declared as undefined.
